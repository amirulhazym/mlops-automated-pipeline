# This is the configuration file for the flake8 code quality tool.
# It allows us to customize the rules for our project.

[flake8]

# Rule: Set the maximum length of a line of code.
# Why: PEP 8 suggests 79 characters, which is very short for modern screens.
# 120 is a common, more practical standard.
max-line-length = 120

# Rule: Ignore specific error codes.
# Why: Sometimes, a rule is not helpful or clashes with other tools.
# We list the specific error codes we want flake8 to ignore.
ignore = E203, E501, W503
# E203: Whitespace before ':' (often clashes with the Black code formatter)
# E501: Line too long (we control this with max-line-length instead)
# W503: Line break before binary operator (an old rule; now breaks are preferred after)
